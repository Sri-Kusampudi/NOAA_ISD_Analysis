###Anaylsis of Integrated Surface Data "Lite" from NOAA weather stations

- The Integrated Surface Database (ISD) consists of global hourly and synoptic observations compiled from numerous sources.
- The database includes over 35,000 stations worldwide, with some having data as far back as 1901, though the data show a substantial increase in volume in the 1940s and again in the early 1970s. Currently, there are over 14,000 "active" stations updated daily in the database.
- **The Goal of the challenge :** is to draw some useful insights from the ISD data.
 The **following documents** give some understaning of the available data.

The data filenames correspond with the station numbers listed in the isd-history.txt file listed below.  For example, 716230-99999-2010.gz corresponds with USAF number 716230 (London Station) and WBAN number 99999.
